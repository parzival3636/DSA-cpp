Selection Sort and Merge Sort ‚Äì Arranging Employees by Average of Height and Weight

### üìñ Problem Definition
Develop a program to:
- Store data for employees (e.g., `employee_name`, `height`, `weight`).  
- Calculate the **average = (height + weight) / 2** for each employee.  
- Sort the list in ascending order of average using:
  - **Selection Sort**
  - **Merge Sort**
- Compare their **time complexities** and conclude which one is more efficient.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Algorithm Overview

#### üî∏ Selection Sort
- Finds the smallest element from the unsorted part and places it at the beginning.
- Repeats this process for all elements.

**Characteristics:**
- **Time Complexity:** O(n¬≤)  
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)  
- **Stable:** No  
- **In-place:** Yes  
- **Best suited for:** Small datasets

---

#### üî∏ Merge Sort
- A **Divide and Conquer** algorithm that:
  1. Divides the array into halves recursively.
  2. Sorts each half.
  3. Merges the sorted halves into one.

**Characteristics:**
- **Time Complexity:** O(n log n)  
- **Space Complexity:** O(n)  
- **Stable:** Yes  
- **In-place:** No (uses temporary arrays)  
- **Best suited for:** Large datasets requiring efficient sorting.

### üß† Conclusion
- **Selection Sort** is simple but inefficient for large data due to its quadratic time complexity.  
- **Merge Sort** is faster for large datasets because of its **O(n log n)** complexity.  
- In practical scenarios like arranging employee records, **Merge Sort** significantly reduces computation time.
